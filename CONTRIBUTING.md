# Contributing to OpenSauced Guestbook

This repository is part of our [Intro to Open Source course](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/). We recommend you to take and complete the course before you contribute to this repository.

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before you begin, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://opensauced.pizza/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct/) and follow the directions below:

## Recommended Communication Style

1. Always leave screenshots for visual changes.
2. Always leave a detailed description in the Pull Request. Leave nothing ambiguous for the reviewer(s).
3. Always review your code first. Be sure to run the project locally and test it before asking for a review.
4. Always communicate in the GitHub repository. Whether it is in the issue or the pull request, keeping the lines of communication open and visible to everyone on the team helps everyone around you.

## Issues

- Issues with the `needs triage` label are unavailable until they are triaged and the label is removed. Feel free to check on the issue regularly if you want to work on it.
- If you wish to work on an open issue, you can comment on it and tag `@open-sauced/docs`. Please refrain from working on an issue before it's assigned to you.

In case you get stuck, feel free to ask for help in the [discussion](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook/discussions/categories/q-a).
